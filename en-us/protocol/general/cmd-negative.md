# Negative Response(0x7F)

## Command Instruction

Negative response ‚Äì a denial reply. This is a type of response that the device must return when, for various reasons,
it cannot correctly execute a command, in order to inform the host of the reason why the command was not
successfully executed.

As explained [üìÑResponse](response.md), positive responses have a fixed reply format, so please pay close attention.

Note:

1. The current key list does not represent functions; instead, it represents types of negative responses.
2. `0x00 ‚Äì Success` will no longer appear in this protocol, as positive responses have their own corresponding reply format.
3. In this section, for `len-key-value`, the `value` serves as an extended supplementary explanation for the
   key
4. For commonly used functions, try to use a single key to directly indicate the reason for failure.
5. For less frequently used functions, use extended keys whenever possible to indicate the reason for failure.

| 0x01 | invalidLength        | Invalid data length                  | During firmware content writing, data must be aligned on a 4-byte boundary, meaning the total number of bytes must be an integer multiple of 4. |
| 0x02 |                      |                                      |                                                              |

| 0x04 | insufficientResource | Insufficient resources               | The device utilizes dynamic memory to store part of the data. If data is transmitted too rapidly, incomplete execution of previous operations may lead to insufficient available memory. In such cases, the host must delay for a specified period before resending the current command. |

| 0x0D | invalidAddress       | Invalid address                      | The offset address is inconsistent when writing firmware content. The<br/>content must be written in the order of the file. |
| 0x0E | internalError        | Internal error                       | The function entry parameter is NULL.                        |

| 0x12 | signatureInvalid     | Signature verification failed        | The initialization packet signature did not pass verification. Check whether the crypto library is consistent. |
| 0x13 | fileSizeInvalid      | File size does not meet requirements | The file to be upgraded is either too small or too large, indicating an abnormal upgrade package. |
| 0x14 | fileCrcError         | File CRC error                       | File content does not match the file CRC described in the initialization packet. |
| 0x15 | timeout              | Timeout                              | Execution of the current command has timed out. The prerequisite tasks were not completed; please resend this command. |
